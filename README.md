## Our Process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - JS library
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node library
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database

### What we learned

In this project, we learned how to efficiently work together as a team, and how to efficiently integrate
git into our work-flow. We ran into merge conflicts as expected and communicated often to resolve
them. We figured out how to fix issues related to saving state between renders, using custom hooks,
and local storage. In addition to how to dynamically change API routes, depending on the environment.
We learned about the differences of regular CSS and Tailwind, and how Tailwind is shorter and
more simple to use. It was trivial to figure out how to get the server and database configured correctly
in order to be compatible with Render. Successful deployment was a huge win, because the path to
getting there was a challenge. We are proud of this project because we made it with all our efforts.
